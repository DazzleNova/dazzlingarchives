    <h1>Welcome to DazzlingGleam's Archive</h1>

    <p>Here's is the archives that weren't uploaded to my main website because I don't want to increase the total size of my website and don't want to bloat it.</p>

    <p>Over time, this place will be filled with things I created throughout the years. I wanted to create a single place to store everything instead of hosting them everywhere to the point it's hard to find thing myself. This will be more convinient for me.</p>
    <p><b>This website is still in it's earliest stages and not close to being finished!</b></p>
